# This script is meant to be sourced, like so:

#   . wasmenv
#
# It will set various environment variables that make it possible to run and
# test WASM targets for Rust. (I got these steps from memchr's CI for doing the
# same, and that was contributed by Alex Crichton.)
#
# Note that this requires that the `wasm32-wasi` target is installed. i.e.,
#
#   rustup target add wasm32-wasi
