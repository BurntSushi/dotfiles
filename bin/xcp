# Simple script to copy to X11 clipboard (or paste to stdout when -o is given).
# Uses xsel if available, and falls back to xclip. xsel is preferred because
# I found that copying using xclip and pasting into certain textareas (gmail,
# google docs) resulted in all newlines being stripped. But using xsel worked
# correctly.
#
# Similarly, we configure neovim to use xsel if available.
