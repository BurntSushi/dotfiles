# This script alerts me if the total combined voltage exceeds a certain
# threshold. I wrote this script (and installed Sense), since we had
# collected some very rough and patchy evidence that we were getting voltage
# spikes into the house. While Sense has some support for notifications, it
# doesn't make voltage data easy to track over time or get notified if it
# spikes. Thankfully, they do have an unofficial API that we scrape using
# homeaut-sense-realtime-log. We then read from that log periodically via this
# script, which is meant to be setup as a cronjob.
